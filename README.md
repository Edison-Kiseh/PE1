# PE1

For my final project as a first year student, i decided to create a webshop. But i gotta say, it one of the least of my favourite projects done so far, as it isn't all that good looking and professional. But hey! i was still a freshman and after that i have created 2 other better looking webshops which also function better so yeah.
