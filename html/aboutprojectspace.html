        <h2>ICT PRACTICE ENTERPRISE 2022-2023</h2><br />
        <p><u>Team</u>: We are going to be making this project in a team of 2 and the participants are the following:</p><br />
        <p><u>Name</u>: Edison Kiseh &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>rnumber</u>: r0937121</p><br />
        <p><u>Name</u>: Abdellah Benameur &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>rnumber</u>: r0909304<p><br />
        <h3>Short description of project:</h3>
        <p>For our Practice Enterprise project of 2022-2023, we are planning to create a webshop, which is
        a website where goods, services or software can be purchased. The kinds of goods that are to be
        sold in our webshop is going to be our own created projects.</p>
        <p>As already mentioned above, we are going to be making this project in a team of 2. We are both
        1st year students so this is something new for us, thus it&rsquo;ll be quite a challenging task. Luckily, we will
        be taking web development lessons during this semester which will gradually teach us how to create
        a website using HTML, JavaScript, CSS...hence the reason why we chose this project. The already
        mentioned languages will be used for creating the front page of the site and enabling interactions
        with the user. We are also going to add a database to the website using MySQL which we already
        learned about during the first semester.</p>
        <h3>Which problem will it solve?</h3>
        <p>These projects will be on display on our webshop. This webshop will help save time for others
        who are needed to create a certain project or just provide them with fun projects at an affordable
        price.</h3>
        <h3>Goals:</h3>
        <p>Our goal for this project is to get the webshop fully functional as in it being able to fully satisfy
        the customer&rsquo;s needs as long as we have what they are looking for and also provide easy access for
        them. We will also strive to beautifully design the site in such a way that it is appealing to the end
        user. We will also set in place a youtube channel which will help advertise our products by showing
        some videos of how we made them plus their end results (how they work etc).</p>
        <h3>Plan of action: objective:</h3>
        <p>This webshop should permit customers to freely browse its products and services, view
        photos/images of the products along with information about the products, specifications, features
        and prices. It should also permit them to freely make purchases based on their preferences.</p>
        <ul><h3>PLAN OF ACTION: FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS:</h3></ul>
        <li>We want our project to be able to act as a website and shop so that we do not have
        to worry about the payment details and order details.</li>
        <li>It is definitely not easy but with the right mindset and problem solving thinking we
        can make sure it will be success.</li>
        <li>The result should be able to welcome the user to our website and ensure that
        everything works like it's supposed to and to make sure that we and the buyer are
        safe when it comes to transactions.</li>
        <li>We have chosen a project where money is not the biggest of our concerns, but time
        and experience are.</li>
